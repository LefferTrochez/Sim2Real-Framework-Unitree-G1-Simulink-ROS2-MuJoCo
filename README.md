## Introduction

This repository presents Version 1.0 of a MATLAB/Simulink-based Sim2Real framework for the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, integrating MuJoCo and ROS 2 within a unified workflow for controller development, simulation-based validation, visualization, and real-robot deployment. The main objective of this repository is to provide a clean and research-oriented framework that preserves a common high-level interface across both simulation and real-robot execution backends.

---

## Framework Overview

The core idea of the framework is to allow the user to develop and organize control logic in MATLAB/Simulink, validate it in MuJoCo, and then transition toward ROS 2-based execution on the real Unitree G1 while maintaining a common structure.

At the center of the repository is a Sim2Real Variant Subsystem, which enables switching between:

- **MuJoCo:** for simulation-based development and testing
- **ROS 2:** for communication and deployment with the real robot

This design keeps the overall workflow modular, structured, and reusable.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```text

├── images/              # Figures used in the documentation and README
└── material/            # Main technical folder of the project
    ├── examples/        # Example files built on top of the original Sim2Real framework (ankle-motion)
    ├── MuJoCo files/    # MuJoCo simulation resources, XML robot model, meshes, and related files
    ├── ROS 2 files/     # Custom Unitree ROS 2 messages and scripts for message generation/integration
    └── Sim2Real files/  # Core reusable Sim2Real base, Variant Subsystem, and support files
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To use this repository, the following components are expected:

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- ROS Toolbox
- Simulink Blockset for MuJoCo Simulator
- A ROS 2 environment
- Access to the Unitree G1 platform if real-robot execution is intended

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the main Simulink framework files.
3. Review the `Sim2Real files` folder.
4. Explore the example files if you want a minimal demonstration of the workflow.
5. Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed in your local environment.

---

## How to Use

1. Open the main Simulink framework contained in the `Sim2Real files` folder.
2. Use the `RUN_MODE` selection inside the framework to choose the desired backend:
   - **MuJoCo**
   - **ROS 2**
3. After changing the selected execution mode, press `Ctrl + D` to update the model.
4. Run the framework from Simulink.
5. Use the example files in the `examples` folder as a reference for building new demonstrations on top of the framework base.

---

## Current Scope

At its current stage, the repository includes:

- A Simulink-centered Sim2Real workflow
- A reusable Variant Subsystem structure
- Integration of MuJoCo and ROS 2 under a common framework logic
- A modular base for future control, estimation, and deployment developments
- A representative example demonstrating how the framework can be extended

---

## Future Work

Planned future developments include:

- Adding more complete examples and demonstrations
- Expanding the documentation and setup instructions
- Improving integration with additional sensors and subsystems
- Extending the framework with more advanced humanoid control modules
- Incorporating additional validation cases in both simulation and real-robot execution

---

## Technologies Used

This project is built around the following technologies:

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- MuJoCo
- XML unitree
- ROS Toolbox
- Simulink Blockset for MuJoCo Simulator
