## Introduction

This repository presents **Version 1.0** of a **MATLAB/Simulink-based Sim2Real framework** for the **Unitree G1 humanoid robot**, integrating **MuJoCo** and **ROS 2** within a unified workflow for controller development, simulation-based validation, visualization, and real-robot deployment.

The main objective of this repository is to provide a clean and research-oriented framework that preserves a common high-level interface across both simulation and real-robot execution backends. This repository also serves as a technical complement to the associated poster and project dissemination material.

## Framework Overview

The core idea of the framework is to allow the user to develop and organize control logic in **MATLAB/Simulink**, validate it in **MuJoCo**, and then transition toward **ROS 2**-based execution on the real **Unitree G1** while maintaining a common structure.

At the center of the repository is a **Sim2Real Variant Subsystem**, which enables switching between:

- **MuJoCo**, for simulation-based development and testing
- **ROS 2**, for communication and deployment with the real robot

This design keeps the overall workflow modular, structured, and reusable.
